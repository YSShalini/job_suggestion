JOB QUEST

Job Quest is an innovative job recommendation portal that simplifies the job search process. Upon logging in, users are directed to their personalized dashboard where Job Quest automatically suggests job offers based on a dataset of company vacancies. The system matches the user's skills with the job requirements to provide relevant recommendations.

Users can search for jobs by location, experience, and skills, making the search process straightforward and convenient. They have the option to save job listings to their profile or apply directly. When applying, an email with the userâ€™s details and resume is automatically sent to the company. Additionally, users can update and manage their profiles to keep their information current.

Job Quest leverages data and technology to streamline job searching and application, ensuring users find opportunities that best fit their skills and preferences.
